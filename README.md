    CONCLUSION
    
By this project I learnt how frontend and backend combined programing can be greatly helpful in making a website. I also learnt visual design, UX design, responsive design, graphic design. I got brief knowledge of some  important languages like html,  css and   javascript. Not only  I have  learned the design aspects of web development, but I have also learned how to program in HTML.  Through evaluating many different web sites, I am aware of what is effective and ineffective to viewers when designing a website too. If restaurant or mess is having online website, there business or market value can be greatly increased. 
 
Through this hands-on project I was able to see how well I understood the material presented, and your critical thinking as I developed this site.  I was also able to show my creative side, through the layout and design of project.
